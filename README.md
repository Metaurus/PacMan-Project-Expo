# PacMan-Project-Expo

The following repository consists of a series of C programs that can be run on an Arduino ChipKit. Unfortunately, the file system isn't well structured, but the user can find all necessary files in the folder RealProject (very original name).

This project features a fully functioning PacMan game that operates on a staggering 128x32 display. It even includes a simple AI system for the ghost enemies to follow you throughout the level, taking collision into account. This was developed for the Computer Hardware and Engineering course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. We, as students, were given solid code foundations to start us off on the project and that is the reasoning for much of the code being claimed by KTH teachers and teacher assistants. Nonetheless, the majority of the C functionality contained within the project were written directly by Edward Leander and Andre Prihodko.

Unfortunately, if you do not have an Arduino ChipKit, then you cannot run the program on your desktop system. In that case, you can appreciate the code for what it's worth.
