# PacMan-Project-Expo

The following repository consists of a series of C programs that can be run on an Arduino ChipKit. Unfortunately, the file system isn't well structured, but the user can find all necessary files in the folder RealProject (very original name). 

This project features a fully functioning PacMan game that operates on a staggering 128x32 display. It even includes a simple AI system for the ghost enemies to follow you throughout the level, taking collision into account. Unfortunately, if you do not have an Arduino ChipKit, then you cannot run the program on your desktop system. In that case, you can appreciate the code for what it's worth.
